Synopsis

This presentation is on Polymorphism and Ruby.
In this different ways to achieve polymorphism is explained with the help of examples.
The different ways to achieve the polymorphism need to be understand.


For Example in Ruby if u type in irb as 1.to_i & "1".to_i 
Both of this statements will not raise any error
So can you think how a string and an integer will call the same method without raising an exception.
This is working in ruby bz of Polymorphism, as in Ruby "Everything is an object"
and all the objects having a particular properties.

"Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types."


The below link will give the description of different ways to achieve Polymorphism in Ruby
